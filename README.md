# NOTE

Moved to [https://github.com/nrwl/nx-ecosystem-ci](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-ecosystem-ci) to make PRs easier and enable issues. This started as a fork of [vitejs/ecosystem-ci](https://github.com/vitejs/ecosystem-ci), so credit goes to the Vite.js team! 

# nx-ecosystem-ci

This repository is used to run integration tests for Nx ecosystem projects. It's inspired by the [vitejs/ecosystem-ci](https://github.com/vitejs/ecosystem-ci).
